				<h2>Contraints</h2>
				<h3>Waterproof:</h3>
				<p> -The material on the top of the umbrella does not absorb water or allow water to pass through it.</p><br>

				<h3>Size:</h3>
				<p> -The small size of the umbrella only allows one or two users to fit comfortable under the umbrella's protection. As more people crowd under, each person receives less protection from the rain.</p><br>

				<h3>Thin Material:</h3>
				<p> -The plastic stretched on top of the umbrella is thin and easily ripped if it comes in contact with a sharp object</p><br>

				<h3>Cultural Constraints:</h3>
				<p> -It is only culturally acceptable to use when raining or sunny</p>
				<p> -Collapsibility is desirable for users in rainy locations who must want to carry it around daily. This also affects what materials are used to manufacture the umbrella as lighter materials are preferred.</p>

				<h2>Affordances</h2>
				<p class="secondtext">1: <span>Affords Holding/Grasping:</span> This affordance is visible because the handle of the umbrella is clearly visible and the only plastic part perceived, making it the most logical place to hold it from.</p><br>

				<p class="secondtext">2: <span>Affords Protection:</span> Protects the user from rain due to its shape and how its used (held above head). Also affords protection due to its size when open its large enough to protect one or two people from rain. This is a perceived affordance.</p><br>

				<p class="secondtext">3: <span>Affords Protection:</span> Protects the user from direct sunlight due to its opaque nature. This also a perceived affordance.</p><br>

				<p class="secondtext">4: <span>Affords Easy Transport:</span> This is due to its collapsibility. This may not be a perceived affordance since the release switch is relatively small and hidden.</p><br>

				<p class="secondtext">5: <span>Affords Multiple Uses:</span> The umbrella is durable (metal and plastic skeleton) and collapsable and is not destroyed after one use, clearly indicating that  it can be reused</p><br>
